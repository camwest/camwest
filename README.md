# Hey, I'm Cameron 👋

I've been building software for twenty years. These days, I'm focused on making AI tools that actually help people get work done.

## What I'm Working On

Right now I'm a Principal Product Engineer at [Tilt](https://tilt.io), where we're building institutional-grade financial analysis tools. Think Bloomberg-level depth with modern product polish.

Before this, I co-founded [Delphia](https://delphia.com), an AI-driven investing app that raised $80M. Wore a few hats over five years: CTO, CPO, and even COO when needed.

## Recent Side Projects

### [video-to-transcript](https://github.com/camwest/video-to-transcript)
Turns videos into clean transcripts so I can read podcasts on my Kindle. Because sometimes I'd rather read than watch.

### [ai-email-checker](https://github.com/camwest/ai-email-checker)
Uses Claude Code SDK to help me triage emails across work and personal accounts. AI that actually saves me time every day.

### [up](https://github.com/camwest/up)
Find your friends at concerts by turning your phone into a unique light signal. Zero friction, no accounts, just hold your phone up and share the link.

## Things I've Built

**[Kera](https://kera.io)** — Context learning automation for design teams. Grew from idea to 5,000 customers in 18 months before Autodesk acquired us.

**[fforward AI](https://fforward.ai)** — Tools to help product managers analyze user interviews and synthesize insights faster.

## What I Care About

I write about [AI, building products, and life stuff](https://cameronwestland.com) when something's been on my mind. Usually it's about how technology changes the way we work and live.

I'm big on:
- Writing code that solves real problems
- Building teams that ship
- Making complex things feel simple
- Being honest about what works and what doesn't
